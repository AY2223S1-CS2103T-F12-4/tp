## Introduction
myStudent is **an easy-to-use, portable and aesthetically-pleasing desktop application for managing students of a tuition center**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface 
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you're able to type fast, myStudent can get your
work done faster than traditional GUI apps.

---
## About
This user guide provides a detailed documentation of how to install and use myStudent. It provides explanations of how 
to use and what it does for all the features available in myStudent. If you don't have any technical knowledge, don't worry as it is not needed to be able to use this guide.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the command format in this user guide:

* **Prefixes** are characters (case-sensitive) followed by a slash and are usually prepended to a field.  
  (E.g., `n/` or `p/`.)


* **Fields** are information to be supplied to the command by the user for the application to execute.  
  (E.g., `name` or `phone`)


* `< >` - indicate that enclosing field is *mandatory*.   
  (E.g., `add n/<name>`, where `<name>` is a mandatory field "name" and a valid input could be `add n/John Doe`.)


* `[ ]` - indicate that the enclosing elements (prefixes and/or fields) are *optional*.  
  (E.g., `n/<name> [#/<tag>]`, where valid inputs could be `add n/John Doe` or `n/John Doe #/male`.)


* Users can input fields of prefixes in any order.  
  (E.g., `nok <index> n/<name> p/<phone>`, where valid inputs could be `nok 2 n/John Doe p/91234567` or `nok 2 n/John Doe p/91234567`. However, `nok n/John Doe p/91234567 2`, where the `<index>` is at the end of the input, is not valid.)


* Extra input from the user for commands that do not take in any fields will be ignored.  
  (E.g., the `clear` command does not have any other fields, thus typing `clear asdfghjkl` into the command box will have the same result as if you had entered `clear` instead.)

</div>

Below is a quick guide on how to get started.

---

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.


2. Download the latest `myStudent.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/releases).


3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.

    <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
    
    :information_source: **Home Folder**  
    Home folder refers to the particular folder that will be containing the `myStudent.jar` file and its relevant files.
    Since myStudent will need to load and save files, it is recommended that you to put `myStudent.jar` in a new folder 
    to ensure a smooth experience when using myStudent.
    
    </div>

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. 

<img src="images/StartingUI.png"/>  

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:pencil2: **Configuring the app**  

You can change the default configurations of the app in the `preference.json` file which is located in the home folder.  
A `preference.json` file will be created when you first run the application, if it doesn't exist initially.  You can then edit the file to customize mystudent to your needs.  

**What you can change:**
* The size of the window such as its height and width (in pixels).


* At which part of the screen the app will be displayed.


* The default theme.


* Where data will be loaded from and stored into.

| Settings 	                            | Default Value 	                       |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Window Width 	                        | 670px 	                               |
| Window Height 	                       | 950px 	                               |
| Window Coordinates 	                  | null 	                                |
| Theme 	                               | Light Theme 	                         |
| Student Address Book Location 	       | data\\\studentaddressbook.json 	      |
| Tutor Address Book Location 	         | data\\\tutoraddressbook.json 	        |
| Tuition Class Address Book Location 	 | data\\\tuitionclassaddressbook.json 	 |

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Alert**  
All your data will be saved as .json files in their respective location as specified above.  
The default location of the files will be in a folder named `data` in your [home folder](#quick-start).  
Do **NOT** modify these files directly as it may cause irreparable damage to your data, cause the application to not work as intended, or both.  
If you need to modify the details of your entries, please do so within the myStudent application. Your data will be saved automatically.  
Some applicable commands that helps to modify your data are: [assign](#assign-class-to-a-person-assign), [unassign](#unassign-class-from-a-person-unassign) and [edit](#editing-an-entity-edit).

* In the student list, `show 1` shows the description of the first student in the list.


* In the tutor list, `show 1` shows the description of the first tutor in the list.


* In the class list, `show 1` is invalid as `show` command can only be executed for the student and tutor list.

Examples:
* `show 3` in the student list

<p align="center">

<img src="images/showCommand_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/showCommand_after.png"/>

</p>

* `show 1` in the class list

<p align="center">

<img src="images/showClassCommand_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/showClassCommand_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that `show` command is invalid for the class list.

### Listing all entities : `list`

Shows a list of the specified entity type in the myStudent database.

Format: `list <entity>`
* The valid entity types are:
  1. student
  2. tutor
  3. class
  <p></p>
* The lists of each entity type can be displayed by clicking any of the tabs above the current displayed list.

Examples:
* `list student`


* `list class`

<p align="center">

<img src="images/listCommand_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/listCommand_after.png"/>

</p>

This changes the current displayed list to the tutor list.

### Clears list: `clear`

Clears either the student, the tutor or the class list.

Format: `clear`

* Please note the list you are clearing as this action is **irreversible**. This can be identified by the tabs above the displayed list.

<p align="center">

<img src="images/clearCommand_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/clearCommand_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the clear command clears the current displayed list only, which in this case is the tutor list. The student list and the class list will remain unchanged.

### Sort list: `sort`

Sorts the current list chronologically, alphabetically, or in reverse order.

Format: `sort <order>`

* `<order>` field should be a valid sort order. The valid orders are as follows:

  * **default**: Sorts the list in order of entries updated from oldest to newest. Editing an entry is considered as updating it.

### Searching by multiple fields: `find`

Finds entities from the current list based on multiple fields such that the fields of the entity specified contains the respective keywords.

Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD [MORE PREFIX/KEYWORD]...`

**To find a student,**<br>
Format: `find [n/<name>] [p/<phone>] [e/<email>] [a/<address>] [s/<school>] [l/<level>] [#/<tag>]`

**To find a tutor,**<br>
Format: `find [n/<name>] [p/<phone>] [e/<email>] [a/<address>] [q/<qualification>] [i/<institution>] [#/<tag>]`

**To find a class,**<br>
Format: `find [n/<name>] [s/<subject>] [l/<level>] [d/day] [t/time] [#/<tag>]`

* All fields are optional, but at least one pair of `PREFIX/KEYWORD` must be specified.


* The input `PREFIX` is case-sensitive and must be in lowercase (e.g., `n/hans e/notgmail.com`).


* The input `KEYWORD` is case-insensitive (e.g., `n/hans` will match a student named “Hans”).


* Partial `KEYWORDS` will be matched (e.g., `n/Ha` will match a student named “Hans Jones”).


* The order of the `PREFIX/KEYWORD` pair does not matter (e.g., `n/Alice p/12345678` vs `p/12345678 n/Alice`).


* `KEYWORDS` must not contain the `/` character.


* If there are repeated `PREFIXES`, only the latest one will be taken.


* The `<time>` field should be searched in the `HH:MM-HH:MM` format (e.g., `find t/18:00` or `find t/09:00-11:00`).


* When searching the `<level>` field, a space must be included between the level and number if the number is to be specified (e.g., `find l/secondary 1` instead of `find l/secondary1`).

Examples:
* `find n/john` 

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findStudent_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findStudent_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the current list is the student list , so `find n/john` returns the students, `John Doe` and `Johnny Tay` in the student list.

* `find i/NUS q/Bachelor of Computing`

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findTutor_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findTutor_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the current list is the tutor lsit, so `find i/NUS q/Bachelor of Computing` returns the tutors graduated from NUS with a Bachelor of Computing qualification.

* `find d/monday #/hard`

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findClass_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findClass_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the current list is the class list, so `find d/monday #/tag` returns all classes conducted on Monday and have the tag “hard”.
