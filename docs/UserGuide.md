## Introduction
myStudent is **a desktop app for managing students of a tuition center, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface 
(CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, myStudent can get 
your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

---
## About
This user guide provides a detailed documentation of how to install and use myStudent. It provides explanations of how 
to use and what it does for all the features available in myStudent. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notes about the command format:

* Prefixes are user inputs that consist of a character followed by a slash  
  e.g. `n/` or `p/`


* `< >` - represent parameters that are supplied by the user.  
  e.g. `add n/<name>, where <name>` is just the name of the parameter and users can input `add n/John Doe`. <br>


* `[ ]` - represent parameters that are optional.  
        e.g `n/<name> [#/<tag>]`, users can input `add n/John Doe` or `n/John Doe #/male`.


* Users can input parameters of prefixes in any order.  
  e.g. `nok <index> n/<name> p/<phone>`, users can either input `nok 2 n/John Doe p/91234567` or `nok 2 n/John Doe p/91234567`.  
  However, `nok n/John Doe p/91234567 2` where <index> is at the end of the input, is not a valid.


* Extra input from the user for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.  
  e.g. the clear command does not have any other parameters, thus the user input clear asdfghjkl is logically the same as if the user typed in clear.

Below is a quick guide on how to get started.

:pencil2: **Configuring the app**  
Users can change the default configurations of the app in the `preference.json` file located in the same place where they download the app into.

<p align="center">

<img src="images/listCommand_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/listCommand_after.png"/>

</p>

This changes the current displayed list to the tutor list.

### Deleting an entity: `delete`

</p>

This deletes the person from the database. Note that if the deleted person is displayed in the Person Description Panel, the panel will update to display the previous person.

### Clears list: `clear`

Clears either the student, the tutor or the class list.

Format: `clear`

* Please note the list you are clearing as this action is **irreversible**. This can be identified by the tabs above the displayed list.

<img src="images/clearCommand_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/clearCommand_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the clear command clears the current displayed list only, which in this case is the tutor list. The student list and the class list will remain unchanged.

### Sort list: `sort`

Sorts the current list chronologically, alphabetically, or in reverse order.

Format: `sort [default/alpha/reverse]`

* **default**: sorts the list in order of entries added from oldest to newest.

<img src="images/sortCommand_after.png"/>

</p>

### Searching by multiple fields: `find`

Finds entities from the current list based on multiple fields such that the fields of the entity specified contains the respective keywords.

* All fields are optional, but at least one pair of `PREFIX/KEYWORD` must be specified.
* The input `PREFIX` is case-sensitive and must be in lowercase. e.g. `n/hans e/notgmail.com`
* The input `KEYWORD` is case-insensitive. e.g. `n/hans` will match a student named “Hans”
* Partial `KEYWORDS` will be matched e.g. `n/Ha` will match a student named “Hans Jones”
* The order of the `PREFIX/KEYWORD` pair does not matter. e.g. `n/Alice p/12345678` vs `p/12345678 n/Alice`
* `KEYWORDS` must not contain the `/` character.
* If there are repeated `PREFIXES`, only the latest one will be taken.

Examples:
* `find n/john` 

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findStudent_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findStudent_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the current list is the student list , so `find n/john` returns the students, `John Doe` and `Johnny Tay` in the student list.

* `find i/NUS q/Bachelor of Computing`

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findTutor_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findTutor_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the current list is the tutor lsit, so `find i/NUS q/Bachelor of Computing` returns the tutors graduated from NUS with a Bachelor of Computing qualification.

* `find d/monday #/hard`

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findClass_before.png"/>

</p>

<p align="center">

<img src="images/findClass_after.png"/>

</p>

Note that the current list is the class list, so `find d/monday #/tag` returns all classes conducted on Monday and have the tag “hard”.
